To run this program, I would recommend using the ipython notebook version, that is what I used.

It is called main.ipynb

Run each step from the top

This notebook follows the layout of the project description on the website.

So, as you go down, it will do the parts in order.

Currently the notebook should have a solution already saved and displayed.

Again, I would highly recommend using ipython notebook version, this is optimized for that.

The functions at the top are used to produce each step in the method

At the bottom of the file, all the functions are listed for a new input in one cell so as to better see how to use program.

As the program stands now, it should run and recompute the images provided.
